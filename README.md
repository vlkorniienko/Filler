# Filler

    This is a game, where two players / algorithm are fighting on a map.

  	The goal of the project is to create your player program to compete against other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed.

 	How the game works:
•  At each turn, the filler will send the updated map and a new token to the player concerned.
•  The player concerned will write on the standard output his or her piece’s coordinates to place it on the board.
 The filler will send the map and a new piece to the other player.
